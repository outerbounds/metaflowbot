## Communicating with the bot

There are two ways interact with the Metaflow bot. You can invite the bot on a `channel` or directly speak to it via `direct message`. For either of the two ways, the following is the general behavior of the bot:

> *When a user messages the bot, the bot will open a new message thread and will engage with the user on the same thread. The user can open multiple threads with the bot. Each thread is an independent discussion*

The following are interaction/UX restrictions based on where the user is conversing with the Metaflow bot.
### Communicating with the bot on a channel

The current [manifest.yml](./manifest.yml) only supports `app_mention` and `message.im` events. This means that users need to specifically mention `@flowey` or `@custombotname` before a command when the bot is invited to a channel. This constraint ensures we don't listen to *all* messages on a channel; only the ones where the bot is called.

### Communicating with the bot through direct messages

Users can message the bot without `@` mentions via direct messages. The bot will support the same command list.
