# Deploying the bot on AWS

There are many ways (automated and manual) to deploy, configure, and manage AWS resources depending on your security posture and familiarity with the AWS eco-system. If you cannot use our [AWS CloudFormation template](../deployment/mfbot-cfn-template.yml), this article lists the steps for a rather straightforward deployment of AWS resources for use by Metaflow bot.

Please note that Metaflow bot can re-use existing AWS resources - for example, your existing ECS cluster for container deployment. The instructions listed here will create these resources from scratch. If you have a strong background in administering AWS resources, you will notice that many of the security policies are fairly permissive and are intended to serve as a starting point for more complex deployments. Please reach out to us if you would like to discuss more involved deployments.

## Manually configuring bot

### Slack Access Tokens

1. [Configure the bot on the slack workspace and retrieve the SLACK_BOT_TOKEN and SLACK_APP_TOKEN](./Setup.md#slack-setup)

1. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)  and in the navigation pane, choose Roles, _Create role_.
2. For _Select type of trusted entity section_, choose _AWS service_.
3. For _Choose the service that will use this role_, choose _Elastic Container Service_.
