If you are interested in deploying the Metaflowbot (either locally or on AWS), take a look at our [deployment guide](./deployment.md).

If you are curious to add more functionality to the bot by creating new commands and actions, you can get started [here](./creating-custom-actions.md). 

If you would like to understand how the bot works, [this article](./architecture.md) is a good starting point. For the security conscious, here are the [Slack scopes](./scopes.md) that Metaflowbot requires to function.

If you would like any assistance, please reach out to as at http://slack.outerbounds.co
